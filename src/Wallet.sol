/**
 * @dev Wallet defines a system to store and transact with funds secured by multiple parties.
 * Intended to store a single users funds, as balances are not segregated within the contract.
 * Every owner (signer) has identical privledges, so that any single owner can be compromised 
 * without compromising the funds. 
 * 
 * Any address may deposit funds to the wallet, but withdrawing requires action from multiple
 * owners. To withdraw funds or execute any arbitrary transaction from the wallet, an owner must
 * first submit the transaction, then other owners must approve it until a custom number of 
 * approvals is met. Only after this can the transaction be executed. The required amount of 
 * approvals should always be strictly less than the amount of owners. The amount of owners should
 * be at least 2, and at most 20.
 * 
 * WARNING: Since any arbitrary transaction can be executed if approved, owners must be careful
 * to check that a submitted transaction is safe. A malicious transaction could simply steal funds
 * or possibly even corrupt the contract state. A flag is attached to every transaction so that if 
 * any owner is suspicious of its intent, they can mark this and other owners can be made aware.
 *
 * Special transactions include adding an owner, removing an owner, and changing the required 
 * amount of approvals. These transactions have special submit functions for convenience, but must
 * be approved and executed the same as any other transaction.
